# MultiRoute

MultiRoute for AngularJS. Make multiple nested views that can transition individual pieces.

## Why do we need this additional API.

When using AngularJS the routes by default only support on ng-view. To make it so you can have as many nested views as you want and be able to control all of those from app.js.
This project comes setup in a multiRoute minimum project so you can see how to set it up.

## Features
This is still under development.

## How to use it.
look at index.html, app.js, controllers.js, and partials folder to see how the pieces fit together.
